# 🛠️ RepoForge

**// Automated repo initializer for disciplined devs**

RepoForge is a command-line tool that forges new GitHub-ready repositories with:

- 📄 Auto-generated `README.md` files  
- 🔐 Pre-filled license templates (MIT, Apache, Proprietary, etc)  
- 🧰 Full folder scaffolding with `.gitignore`  
- 🗃️ License vaults tied to your legal name  
- 🧙 Wizard mode for guided setup  

---

## ⚡ Features

- `forge.sh` wizard: Walks you through name, license, and scaffolding  
- License vault: Stores licenses linked to your identity (encrypted if desired)  
- Project types: Frontend, Backend, Full Stack (more coming soon)  
- Zero dependencies. Just run and forge.  
- One-liners: Alias-friendly for terminal speed demons
